- [ ] Delta updates configured

### 📝 Documentation
- [ ] API documentation up to date
- [ ] Deployment procedures documented
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan in place
- [ ] Security procedures documented
- [ ] Operational runbooks created

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final QA Verification
```bash
cd /workspace/edge
./qa-pipeline.sh
```

### 2. Generate Production Secrets
```bash
cd /workspace/edge
./generate-production-secrets.sh
```

### 3. Build Production Images
```bash
cd /workspace
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
```

### 4. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging environment first
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### 5. Run Smoke Tests
```bash
# Verify all services are healthy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
curl -k https://localhost/healthz
```

### 6. Production Deployment
```bash
# After staging validation, deploy to production
./edge/deploy-production.sh
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] All containers running
- [ ] Health endpoints responding
- [ ] No error logs in first 5 minutes
- [ ] Search functionality working
- [ ] Authentication flow verified
- [ ] Update system accessible

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Response times within SLA
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] CPU usage stable
- [ ] Disk I/O normal

### Security Validation
- [ ] mTLS working correctly
- [ ] JWT validation functioning
- [ ] No unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Security headers present

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected post-deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml.backup up -d
   ```

2. **Data Recovery**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery.sh restore
   ```

3. **Incident Response**
   - Document the issue
   - Gather logs
   - Root cause analysis
   - Update deployment procedures

## Sign-Off

| Role | Name | Date | Signature |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| Development Lead | | | |
| Security Officer | | | |
| Operations Lead | | | |
| QA Lead | | | |

## Notes
- Always deploy to staging first
- Monitor for at least 24 hours before promoting to production
- Keep backup of previous version for quick rollback
- Document any deviations from this checklist
