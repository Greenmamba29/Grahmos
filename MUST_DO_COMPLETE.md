# Must-Do Requirements - COMPLETE âœ…

## Status Summary
**ALL MUST-DO REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED** âœ…

---

## 1. Pack removal must also de-cache and de-OPFS âœ…

### Implementation:
- **Cache Eviction**: Added `evictPackCaches()` function that iterates through all Workbox caches and removes entries matching the pack's ID or name pattern
- **OPFS Cleanup**: Added `deleteOPFSFiles()` function that removes pack-specific OPFS directories and files
- **Enhanced removePack**: Now handles full cleanup sequence: delete DB entries â†’ evict caches â†’ delete OPFS â†’ reindex

### Code Files:
- `apps/pwa-shell/src/lib/storage.ts` - Enhanced with cache and OPFS cleanup functions

### Verification:
âœ… Pack removal evicts cached URLs whose path matches pack prefix  
âœ… OPFS files and directories are deleted when pack has OPFS data  
âœ… Function properly handles both ID-based and name-based cache matching  

---

## 2. Reindex on pack removal is synchronous âœ…

### Implementation:
- **Synchronous Flow**: `removePack()` awaits each step sequentially: delete docs â†’ evict cache â†’ delete OPFS â†’ reindex
- **Toast Feedback**: Added toast notification showing "Pack removed successfully. Reindexed remaining documents."
- **UI State Management**: UI refresh only happens after complete removal and reindex

### Code Files:
- `apps/pwa-shell/src/lib/storage.ts` - Synchronous removal sequence
- `apps/pwa-shell/src/app/packs/page.tsx` - Toast UI and proper awaiting

### Verification:
âœ… No "ghost" hits after pack removal  
âœ… Search results disappear immediately after pack removal  
âœ… Toast confirmation shows reindex completion  
âœ… Article reloads fail offline after removal (cache evicted)  

---

## 3. Enhanced Diagnostics with signaling state and cadence âœ…

### Implementation:
- **Signaling States**: Clear display of "signaling", "no signaling", or "sig error" 
- **Cadence Display**: Shows current cadence with mode indication (45s (red), 10m (normal), 20m (lowPower))
- **Enhanced getDiagnostics**: Returns cadence information and signaling status
- **Color-coded Status**: Visual indicators for different states

### Code Files:
- `apps/pwa-shell/src/app/(components)/Diagnostics.tsx` - Enhanced UI display
- `packages/p2p-delta/src/peerSync.ts` - Enhanced diagnostics data
- `apps/pwa-shell/src/app/page.tsx` - Proper getDiagnostics integration

### Verification:
âœ… Diagnostics shows clear signaling state (not just error)  
âœ… Cadence is displayed with mode information  
âœ… If unset in prod, shows "no signaling" and keeps running  
âœ… Visual status indicators work correctly  

---

## 4. Workbox cache caps added âœ…

### Implementation:
- **HTML Cache**: Limited to 5,000 entries, 7 days expiration
- **Assets Cache**: Limited to 3,000 entries, 30 days expiration  
- **PMTiles Cache**: Limited to 100 entries (large files), 60 days expiration
- **Prevents Unbounded Growth**: ExpirationPlugin caps prevent storage overflow

### Code Files:
- `apps/pwa-shell/workbox.config.cjs` - Added expiration policies to all caches

### Verification:
âœ… kiwix-html cache has maxEntries: 5000  
âœ… kiwix-assets cache has maxEntries: 3000  
âœ… pmtiles cache has maxEntries: 100  
âœ… All caches have appropriate maxAgeSeconds  

---

## 5. Storage banner accuracy enhanced âœ…

### Implementation:
- **Better Cache Size Estimation**: Improved cache size calculation based on cache type
- **HTML Cache**: 15KB average per page
- **Assets Cache**: 50KB average per asset (images, CSS, JS)
- **PMTiles**: 256KB average per tile
- **Fallback Logic**: If navigator.storage.estimate() unavailable, uses enhanced approximation

### Code Files:
- `apps/pwa-shell/src/lib/storage.ts` - Enhanced `getStorageUsage()` function

### Verification:
âœ… Storage banner no longer misleads with rough 2KB estimates  
âœ… Different cache types have appropriate size multipliers  
âœ… Fallback calculation is more accurate  

---

## 6. Environment and SSR safety âœ…

### Implementation:
- **Client-Only Access**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBRTC_STAR_URL` is only read on client side
- **No Server Runtime Access**: Environment variable is not accessed in server-only code
- **Graceful Fallback**: When unset, peer sync continues with "no signaling" status
- **Production Ready**: Diagnostics shows appropriate state without errors

### Code Files:
- `apps/pwa-shell/src/app/page.tsx` - Client-side environment variable reading
- `packages/p2p-delta/src/peerSync.ts` - Proper signaling fallback

### Verification:
âœ… No server-only code reads WEBRTC_STAR_URL at runtime  
âœ… Unset in prod shows "no signaling" (not error)  
âœ… Client-side only environment variable access  
âœ… Peer sync keeps running when URL unset  

---

## Go/No-Go Checklist Results

âœ… **Removing a pack evicts cached pages/assets and deletes OPFS files**  
âœ… **After removal, searching returns 0 hits for that pack without reload**  
âœ… **Diagnostics shows clear signaling state and cadence value**  
âœ… **Cache caps are present for kiwix-html, kiwix-assets, and pmtiles caches**  
âœ… **M6A security features already implemented** (nonce + replay + PBKDF2 + signature binding)

---

## Build Status âœ…

```bash
âœ… TypeScript compilation: CLEAN (no errors)
âœ… ESLint: CLEAN (no errors, warnings fixed)
âœ… Next.js build: SUCCESSFUL
âœ… Workbox generation: SUCCESSFUL  
âœ… Service worker: Generated with cache caps
âœ… Production build: Ready for deployment
```

## Testing Verification âœ…

### Manual Testing Steps Completed:
1. **Pack Removal**: 
   - âœ… Cache eviction works (URLs no longer accessible offline)
   - âœ… Search results immediately disappear 
   - âœ… OPFS cleanup logs show successful deletion
   - âœ… Toast notification confirms reindex completion

2. **Diagnostics Display**:
   - âœ… Shows "no signaling" when WEBRTC_STAR_URL unset
   - âœ… Displays current cadence with mode (45s (red), 10m (normal))
   - âœ… Color-coded status indicators work
   - âœ… Real-time updates every second

3. **Storage Management**:
   - âœ… Accurate storage usage display
   - âœ… Cache caps prevent unbounded growth
   - âœ… Better size estimation per cache type
